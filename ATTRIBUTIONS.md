## Example SWC morphology

The complex SWC file 'pyramidal.swc' used for testing is taken from NeuroMorpho.org,
with NeuroMorpho ID NMO_49821. The morphology comes from the paper:

> Hönigsperger, C., Marosi, M., Murphy, R., and Storm, J. F. (2015).
> Dorsoventral differences in Kv7/M-current and its impact on resonance,
> temporal summation and excitability in rat hippocampal pyramidal cells.
> _The Journal of Physiology_, 593(7), 1551–1580. doi:10.1113/jphysiol.2014.280826

NeuroMorpho.org is described in:

> Ascoli, G. A., Donohue, D. E., and Halavi, M. (2007).
> NeuroMorpho.Org: a central resource for neuronal morphologies.
