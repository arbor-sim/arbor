# v0.8.1

** 2022 12 20 **

A 🎄 holiday release! Not much has changes in a month, but we'd like to share it all the same. Notably, the [Arbor GUI](https://github.com/arbor-sim/gui/) [is co-released](https://github.com/arbor-sim/gui/releases/tag/v0.8) as of Arbor v0.8, and v0.8.1 will be no different.

## Major new features

- Voltage Processes: add the VOLTAGE_PROCESS mechanism kind to modcc, allowing for direct writing to the membrane voltage (#2033)
- Spack gpu option: added conditional variant for cuda builds to enable GPU-based random number generation (#2043) 
- SDE Tutorial (#2044) 

## Breaking changes since v0.7

- None 💃!

## Bug fixed

- Fix ornstein_uhlenbeck example on gpu (#2039)
- Setting ARB_MODCC was broken and nunfunctional. Fixed. (#2029)
- The `--cxx` flag in `arbor-build-catalogue` is now properly used; falls back to `c++`. (#2051)

# v0.8

** 2022 11 15 **

Welcome to another installment of the Arbor simulator!

In this release we add a CHANGELOG, where major new features and breaking changes will be mentioned specifically.

## Major new features

- Stochastic Differential Equations. Introduces sources of white noise to arbor (and nmodl). Both point and density mechanisms may now use white noise as part of the state updates, turning the ODEs effectively into SDEs. The noise sources are provided per connection end point (point mech.) or control volume (density mech.) and are uncorrelated (spatially, temporally and across different mechanism instantiations). https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor/pull/1884
- Mutable connection table. Add functionality, docs, and examples on editing the connection table. This is a first, small PR
on the topic, further functionality will come as requested. https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor/pull/1919
- Allow editing morphologies. Supported operations: join_at, split_at, equivalence, equality, apply isometry. https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor/pull/1957
- Arbor cable cell exporter and backend support in BluePyOpt. https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor/pull/1959
- Make LIF cells probeable. https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor/pull/2021

## Breaking changes since v0.7:

- A change in decor API: `arbor.cable_cell` has the labels and decor arguments swapped. I.e.: `(tree, labels, decor)`
-> `(tree, decor, label)`. Labels are now optional. https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor/pull/1978
- Remove the `generate-catalogue` script.  `modcc` accepts now a list of NMODL files and is able to spit out a catalogue.cpp file. https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor/pull/1975
- Mechanism ABI version is bumped to 0.3.1. https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor/pull/1884
- Rename spike detector -> threshold detector. https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor/pull/1976
- Remove access to time `t` in NMODL. https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor/pull/1967
- Major dependency version bumps:
  - GCC: 9 and up
  - CUDA: 11 and up
  - Clang: 10 and up

Core API features:
* [C++/Python] Numerous small bug fixes, optimizations and improvements.
* [C++/Python] Refactor cable cell interface to be read only, and be constructed from

* Add extensive guide for contributions and coding polices.

Build:
* Allow CMake configuration to use system copies of C++ dependencies
  (nlohmann/json and pybind11), and makes this the default option.
* Added GitHub Actions support for automated testing of a wider range of tests
  and features than are run on our Travis CI (which will be removed soon)
* More robust Python detection and consistent use of the same Python
  interpreter in CMake configure and build steps.

# v0.4

** 2019 10 15 **

## Release notes

### Library
* Moved from C++14 to C++17
    * Removed our hand-rolled versions of `any`, `optional` and `variant`.
* Added `std::expected` equivalent for error handling.

### Features
* Added mechanism catalogues with mechanisms used by Allen and BBP models.
* Removed support for spherical segments at the root of cable morphologies, and
  replaced the sample-based representation with a segment-based representation:
    * Morphologies are defined in terms of two-point segments.
    * Gaps are allowed between segments anywhere in a morphology.
* Exposed the current `time` inside mechanisms.
* Added support for NeuroML2 morphology descriptions.
* Added a "stitch" morphology builder for constructing morphologies with
  cable sections that can connect to any location on their parent cable.                    
* Replaced recipe probe API with more flexible API that allows for sampling
  not only voltages at single locations, but currents, ion species properties,
  and mechanism state variables at single locations or across an entire cell.
* Added support for querying probe metadata from the simulation object.
* Added new 'place_pwlin' C++ API for cell geometry queries.
* Added support for loading Allen SDK cell model morphologies from SWC.
* Added support for composing policies for creating compartments over sub-regions.

### Documentation
* Restructured documentation to have cleaner separation between high level descriptions
  of concepts and the C++ and Python APIs.
* Added high level documentation for morphology descriptions, labels and cable cell
  construction.

### Optimizations
* Implemented memory optimizations for GPU matrix solver.
* Added support for ARM SVE intrinsics in the vectorized CPU back end.

### Bug Fixes
* Fixed various modcc code generation errors.

# v0.2

** 2019 03 04 **

**Arbor** library **version 0.2**, tagged as `v0.2`

Arbor is a library for implementing performance portable network simulations of multi-compartment neuron models.

An installation guide and library documentation are available online at [Read the Docs](https://arbor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

[Submit a ticket](https://github.com/eth-cscs/arbor) if you have any questions or want help.


Some key features include:

  * Optimized back ends for CUDA, KNL, AVX2, ARM NEON intrinsics.
  * Asynchronous spike exchange that overlaps compute and communication.
  * Efficient sampling of voltage and current on all back ends.
  * Efficient implementation of all features on GPU.
  * Reporting of memory and energy consumption (when available on platform).
  * An API for addition of new cell types, e.g. LIF and Poisson spike generators.

## Change Log

Changes since [v0.1](https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor/releases/tag/v0.1):

  * A new Hines matrix solver back end for the GPU that parallelises over cell
    branches, not cells, to increase the amount of parallelism. See #631.
  * Support for describing and simulating electrical gap junctions. See #661 #686.
  * An additional library `libarborenv` is now installed with useful
    helper functionality for managing the environment (e.g. detecting the number of available CPU cores). See #679.
  * Detection and allocation of GPUs to MPI ranks on systems with more than one GPU per node in `libarborenv`. See #659 and #654.
  * The miniapp example was removed and replaced with a simple single cell model that shows how to use morphologies. See #703 and #710.
  * Support for ARM NEON intrinsics. See #698.
  * Basic Python support. Full Python support is slated for v0.3. See #668.
