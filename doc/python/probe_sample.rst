Cable cell probing and sampling
===============================

.. module:: arbor

.. figure:: probe_sample-diag.svg
    :width: 800
    :align: center

    A schematic view of how :term:`handles <handle>` let you access sampled data measured at a :term:`probeset`.
    A probeset is a probe placed on a locset (which may describe more than one point). 
    When setting a probe on a locset a :term:`sampler` is created.
    When this sampler is set to sampling (at a certain schedule), a handle is returned.
    This figure demonstrates how sampling data can be accessed through the handle associated with the probeset.
    See below for a possible result for ``data``.

.. code-block:: python
   
   print(data) # The probe data printed, as found in single_cell_recipe.py
   [[ 0.00000000e+00 -4.00000000e+01]
    [ 1.00000000e-01 -5.40211646e+01]
    [ 2.00000000e-01 -6.19670534e+01]
    ...
    [ 2.99000000e+01 -6.44564354e+01]]

Sample data recorded by the Arbor simulation object is returned in the form 
of a NumPy array, with the first column holding sample times, and subsequent 
columns holding the corresponding scalar- or vector-valued sample.

Probesets are defined over a location expression and will describe zero,
one, or more probes, one per site. They are evaluated in the context of
the cell to which the probe is attached.

:term:`Vector probes <vector probe>` are a kind of probes that samples over a region, rather than a :term:`locset`.
This means that they may output more than a single data point per timestamp. The layout of the outputs as returned
by :func:`~arbor.simulation.samples` is slightly different, but contains the same sort of information as regular
:term:`probesets <probeset>`.

.. figure:: probe_sample_vector-diag.svg
    :width: 800
    :align: center

    The structure of the data returned is slightly different when a :term:`vector probe` is sampled.
    The same kind of information is included however. Instead of returning a list per :term:`probe` in a :term:`probeset`,
    the data and metadata now have an extra dimension to cover for the multitude of subregions.


Each of the functions described below generates an opaque :class:`probe`
object for use in the recipe :py:func:`recipe.probes` method.

More information on probes, probe metadata, and sampling can be found
in the documentation for the class :class:`simulation`.

.. note::

   Cable cell probesets are defined analogously to their counterparts in
   the C++ API (see :ref:`cablecell-probes` for details). Some details 
   like `probe_tag` are not exposed in Python, as having Python probe callbacks
   has proven to be too slow.

Example
-------


.. code-block:: python
   
   import arbor as A

   tree = A.segment_tree()
   p = tree.append(A.mnpos, A.mpoint(-3, 0, 0, 3), A.mpoint(3, 0, 0, 3), tag=1)
   tree.append(p, A.mpoint(3, 0, 0, 3), A.mpoint(-3, 0, 0, 3), tag=2)
   tree.append(p, A.mpoint(3, 0, 0, 3), A.mpoint(-3, 0, 0, 3), tag=2)

   decor = (
      A.decor()
      .set_property(Vm=-40)
      .paint('"soma"', A.density("hh"))
      .place('"midpoint"', A.iclamp(10*U.ms, 2*U.ms, 0.8*U.nA), "iclamp"))

   cell = A.cable_cell(tree, decor)

   class single_recipe(A.recipe):
      def __init__(self):
         A.recipe.__init__(self)

      def num_cells(self):
         return 1

      def cell_kind(self, gid):
         return A.cell_kind.cable

      def cell_description(self, gid):
         return cell

      def probes(self, gid):
         return [A.cable_probe_membrane_voltage('(location 0 0.5)'),
                 A.cable_probe_membrane_voltage_cell(),
                 A.cable_probe_membrane_voltage('(join (location 0 0) (location 0 1))'),
                  ]

      # (4.6) Override the global_properties method
      def global_properties(self, kind):
         return A.neuron_cable_properties()

   recipe = single_recipe()
   sim = A.simulation(recipe)
   handles = [sim.sample((0, n), A.regular_schedule(0.1*U.ms))
            for n in range(3) ]
   sim.run(tfinal=1*U.ms)

   for hd in handles:
      print("Handle", hd)
      for d, m in sim.samples(hd):
         print(" * Meta:", m)
         print(" * Payload:", d.shape)

This script has a single (scalar) probe, a single vector probe, and a probeset involving two scalar probes.
The script is complete and can be run with Arbor installed, and will output:

.. code-block::

   Handle 0
   * Meta: (location 0 0.5)
   * Payload: (10, 2)
   Handle 1
   * Meta: [(cable 0 0 1), (cable 0 1 1), (cable 1 0 0), (cable 2 0 0), (cable 1 0 1), (cable 2 0 1)]
   * Payload: (10, 7)
   Handle 2
   * Meta: (location 0 0)
   * Payload: (10, 2)
   * Meta: (location 0 1)
   * Payload: (10, 2)
