Cable cell decoration
=====================

.. currentmodule:: arbor

.. py:class:: decor

    A decor object contains a description of the cell dynamics to be applied
    to a morphology when used to instantiate a :py:class:`cable_cell`

    .. method:: __init__()

        Construct an empty decor description.

    Properties for which defaults can be defined over the entire cell, specifically
    :ref:`cable properties <cablecell-properties>` and :ref:`ion properties <cablecell-ions>`,
    are set with ``set_property`` and ``set_ion`` methods.

    .. method:: set_property(Vm=None, cm=None, rL=None, tempK=None)

        Set default values of cable properties on the whole cell.
        Overrides the default global values, and can be overridden by painting
        the values onto regions.

        :param Vm: Initial membrane voltage [mV].
        :type Vm: float or None
        :param cm: Membrane capacitance [F/m²].
        :type cm: float or None
        :param rL: Axial resistivity of cable [Ω·cm].
        :type rL: float or None
        :param tempK: Temperature [Kelvin].
        :type tempK: float or None

        .. code-block:: Python

            import arbor as A
            # Set cell-wide values for properties for resistivity and capacitance
            decor = A.decor()
            decor.set_property(rL=100 * U.Ohm * U.cm, cm=0.1 * U.F/ U.m2)

    .. method:: set_ion(ion, int_con=None, ext_con=None, rev_pot=None, method=None)

        Set default value for one or more properties of a specific ion on the whole cell.
        Set the properties of ion species named ``ion`` that will be applied
        by default everywhere on the cell. Species concentrations and reversal
        potential can be overridden on specific regions using the paint interface,
        while the method for calculating reversal potential is global for all
        CVs in the cell, and can't be overridden locally.

        :param str ion: description of the ion species.
        :param float int_con: initial internal concentration [mM].
        :type int_con: float or None.
        :param float ext_con: initial external concentration [mM].
        :type ext_con: float or None.
        :param float rev_pot: reversal potential [mV].
        :type rev_pot: float or None
        :param method: method for calculating reversal potential.
        :type method: :py:class:`mechanism` or None

        .. code-block:: Python

            import arbor as A
            # Set nernst reversal potential method for calcium.
            ca_mech = A.mechanism('nernst/x=ca')
            decor.set_ion('ca', method=ca_mech)

            # Set reversal potential and concentration for sodium.
            # The reversal potential is fixed, so we set the method to None.
            decor.set_ion('na', int_con=5.0 * U.mM, rev_pot=70 * U.mV, method=None)

    Various specialisations of the ``paint`` method are available for setting properties
    and density mechanisms that are applied to regions.

    .. method:: paint(region, Vm=None, cm=None, rL=None, tempK=None)

        Set cable properties on a region. A property ``v`` is given as a float
        or a string. In the latter, ``v`` will be interpreted as an inhomogeneous
        expression.

        :param str region: description of the region.
        :param Vm: Initial membrane voltage [mV].
        :type Vm: float, str, or None
        :param cm: Membrane capacitance [F/m²].
        :type cm: float, str, or None
        :param rL: Axial resistivity of cable [Ω·cm].
        :type rL: float, str, or None
        :param tempK: Temperature [Kelvin].
        :type tempK: float, str, or None

        .. code-block:: Python

            # Specialize resistivity on soma
            decor.paint('"soma"', rL=100 * U.Ohm * U.cm)
            # Specialize resistivity and capacitance on the axon, where
            # axon is defined using a region expression.
            decor.paint('(tag 2)', cm=0.05 * U.F/U.m2, rL=80 * U.Ohm * U.cm)
            # Specialize resistivity on soma and set :math:`r_L(s) = 42.0 \cdot d(s)`
            # where `s` parametrises the cable segment(s) and :math:`d(s)` is the cable
            # diameter at `s`.
            decor.paint('"soma"', rL='(mul 42 (diameter))')

    .. method:: paint(region, name, int_con=None, ext_con=None, rev_pot=None)
        :noindex:

        Set ion species properties initial conditions on a region. A property
        ``v`` is given as a float or a string. In the latter, ``v`` will be
        interpreted as an inhomogeneous expression.
