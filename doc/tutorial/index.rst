Tutorials
=========

Grouped loosely by primary (but not exclusive!) focus, we have a set of tutorials to help you learn by doing. 

You can find some examples of full Arbor simulations in the ``python/examples`` directory of the
`Arbor repository <https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor>`_.

The examples use ``pandas``, ``seaborn`` and ``LFPykit`` for analysis and plotting which are expected to be
installed independently from Arbor.

In an interactive Python interpreter, you can use ``help()`` on any class or function to get its
documentation. (Try, ``help(arbor.simulation)``, for example).

Demonstrations
--------------

We try to collect models scientists have built in our `contributor space <https://github.com/arbor-contrib/>`_.
In addition to the tutorials, browsing these models should give you a good idea of what's possible with Arbor
and find get in contact with other Arbor users.
