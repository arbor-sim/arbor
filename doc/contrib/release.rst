Procedure
=========

These notes enumerate the steps required every time we release a new
version of Arbor.

Pre-release
-----------

Update tags/versions and test
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

0. Check README.md, ATTRIBUTIONS.md, CONTRIBUTING.md.
1. Create new temp-branch ending in ``-rc``. E.g. ``v0.6-rc``
2. Bump the ``VERSION`` file:
   https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor/blob/master/VERSION
   Don't append ``-rc`` here, but if you do, remove it before releasing.
3. Run all tests.
   - ``ciwheel.yml`` triggers when you push a branch called ``v*rc``, ON YOUR OWN REPO (so check ``github.com/$yourname/arbor/actions``). Make sure the tests pass.
   - This should catch many problems. For a manual check:
   - Verify MANIFEST.in (required for PyPI sdist)
   - Check Python/pip/PyPi metadata and scripts, e.g. ``setup.py``
   - Double check that all examples/tutorials/etc are covered by CI

Test the RC
~~~~~~~~~~~

4. Collect artifact from the above GA run.
   In case you want to manually want to trigger ``ciwheel.yml`` GA, overwrite the ``ciwheel`` branch with the commit of your choosing and force push to Github.
5. ``twine upload -r testpypi dist/*``
6. Ask users to test the above, e.g.:

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m venv env && source env/bin/activate
   pip install numpy
   pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ arbor==0.6-rc
   python -c 'import arbor; print(arbor.__config__)'

Release
-------

0. Make sure ``ciwheel.yml`` passes tests, produced working wheels, and nobody reported problems testing the RC.
   Make sure ``VERSION`` does not end with ``-rc`` or ``-dev``

1. Create tarball with
   ``scripts/create_tarball ~/loc/of/arbor tagname outputfile``

   -  eg ``scripts/create_tarball /full/path/to/arbor v0.5.1 ~/arbor-v0.5.1-full.tar.gz``

2. Tag and release: https://github.com/arbor-sim/arbor/releases

   -  on cmdline: git tag -a TAGNAME
   -  git push upstream TAGNAME
   -  Go to `GH tags`_ and click “…” and “Create release”
   -  Go through merged PRs to come up with a changelog
      Or categorize/edit Github's autogenerated release notes.
   - add tarball to release, created in previous step.

3. [`AUTOMATED`_] push to git@gitlab.ebrains.eu:arbor-sim/arbor.git
4. Download output of wheel action associated to this release commit and extract (verify the wheels and
   source targz is in /dist)

   - Of course, the above action must have passed the tests successfully.

5. Upload to TEST pypi & verify

.. code-block:: bash

   twine upload -r arborpypi dist/*
   python -m venv env && source env/bin/activate
   pip install numpy
   pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ arbor==0.6
   python -c 'import arbor; print(arbor.__config__)'

6. Upload to pypi

.. code-block:: bash

   twine upload -r arborpypi dist/*

   python -m venv env && source env/bin/activate
   pip install numpy
   pip install arbor==0.6 –verbose
   python -c 'import arbor; print(arbor.__config__)'

7. Update spack package

   -  first, update ``spack/package.py``. The checksum of the targz is the sha256sum.
   -  Then, use the file to `make PR here <https://github.com/spack/spack/blob/develop/var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/>`_

8. In the same PR with the update to `spack/package.py`, bump `VERSION` file.

   - e.g. to 0.6.1-dev
