.. cpp:class:: cell_connection

    Describes a connection between two cells: a pre-synaptic source and a
    post-synaptic target. The source is typically a threshold detector on
    a cell or a spike source. The target is a synapse on the post-synaptic cell.

    The :cpp:member:`target` does not include the gid of a cell, this is because a
    :cpp:class:`cell_connection` is bound to the target cell, which means that the gid
    is implicitly known.

    .. cpp:member:: cell_global_label_type source

        Source end point, represented by a :cpp:type:`cell_global_label_type` which packages
        a cell gid, label of a group of sources on the cell, and source selection policy.

    .. cpp:member:: cell_local_label_type target

        Destination end point on the cell, represented by a :cpp:type:`cell_local_label_type`
        which packages a label of a group of targets on the cell and a selection policy.
        The target cell's gid is implicitly known.

    .. cpp:member:: float weight

        The weight delivered to the target synapse.
        The weight is dimensionless, and its interpretation is
        specific to the synapse type of the target. For example,
        the ``expsyn`` synapse interprets it as a conductance
        with units μS (micro-Siemens).

    .. cpp:member:: units::quantity delay

        Delay of the connection (milliseconds), must be positive and finite.

.. cpp:class:: ext_cell_connection

    Describes a connection between two cells: a pre-synaptic source and a
    post-synaptic target. The source is typically a threshold detector on
    a cell or a spike source. The target is a synapse on the post-synaptic cell.

    The :cpp:member:`target` does not include the gid of a cell, this is because a
    :cpp:class:`ext_cell_connection` is bound to the target cell, which means that the ``gid``
    is implicitly known.

    .. cpp:member:: cell_remote_label_type source

        Source end point, comprising

        - global id, uniquely identifying the source object inside the remote simulation,
        - local id, uniquely identifying the location of the source on the source object,
        - selection policy, how to map sources ``(gid, lid)`` to the targets in Arbor.

    .. Note::

       The tuple ``(gid, lid)`` must be unique for each source. This addressing
       scheme follows Arbor's model of multiple sources (threshold detectors) per
       cell. If the remote simulation does not provide multiple items per source
       object, ``lid`` can be ignored and set to zero.


    .. cpp:member:: cell_local_label_type target

        Destination end point on the cell, represented by a :cpp:type:`cell_local_label_type`
        which packages a label of a group of targets on the cell and a selection policy.
        The target cell's gid is implicitly known.

    .. cpp:member:: float weight

        The weight delivered to the target synapse.
        The weight is dimensionless, and its interpretation is
        specific to the synapse type of the target. For example,
        the `expsyn` synapse interprets it as a conductance
        with units μS (micro-Siemens).

    .. cpp:member:: float delay

        Delay of the connection (milliseconds).


.. cpp:class:: gap_junction_connection

    Describes a gap junction connection between two gap junction sites. The :cpp:member:`local` site does
    not include the gid of a cell, this is because a :cpp:class:`gap_junction_connection` is bound to the local
    cell, which means that the gid is implicitly known.

    .. note::

       A bidirectional gap-junction connection between two cells ``c0`` and ``c1`` requires two
       :cpp:class:`gap_junction_connection` objects to be constructed: one where ``c0`` is the
       :cpp:member:`local` site, and ``c1`` is the :cpp:member:`peer` site; and another where ``c1`` is the
       :cpp:member:`local` site, and ``c0`` is the :cpp:member:`peer` site.

    .. cpp:member:: cell_global_label_type peer

        Peer gap junction site, represented by a :cpp:type:`cell_local_label_type` which packages a cell gid,
        a label of a group of gap junction sites on the cell, and a site selection policy.

    .. cpp:member:: cell_local_label_type local

        Local gap junction site on the cell, represented by a :cpp:type:`cell_local_label_type`
        which packages a label of a group of gap junction sites on the cell and a selection policy.
        The gid of the local site's cell is implicitly known.
