Cable cell probing and sampling
===============================

.. _cppcablecell-probes:

Cable cell probes
-----------------

Various properties of a cable cell can be sampled. They fall into two classes:
scalar probes are associated with a single real value, such as a membrane
voltage or mechanism state value at a particular location; vector probes return
multiple values corresponding to a quantity sampled at a set of points on the
cell.

The sample data associated with a cable cell probe will either be a ``double``
for scalar probes, or a ``cable_sample_range`` describing a half-open range of
``double`` values:

.. code::

   using cable_sample_range = std::pair<const double*, const double*>

The probe metadata passed to the sampler will be a const pointer to:

*   ``mlocation`` for most scalar probes;

*   ``cable_probe_point_info`` for point mechanism state queries;

*   ``mcable_list`` for most vector queries;

*   ``std::vector<cable_probe_point_info>`` for cell-wide point mechanism state queries.

The type ``cable_probe_point_info`` holds metadata for a single target on a cell:

.. code::

    struct cable_probe_point_info {
        // Target number of point process instance on cell.
        cell_lid_type target;

        // Number of combined instances at this site.
        unsigned multiplicity;

        // Point on cell morphology where instance is placed.
        mlocation loc;
    };

Note that the ``multiplicity`` will always be 1 if synapse coalescing is
disabled.

Cable cell probes that contingently do not correspond to a valid measurable
quantity are ignored: samplers attached to them will receive no values.
Mechanism state queries, however will throw a ``cable_cell_error`` exception at
simulation initialization if the requested state variable does not exist on the
mechanism.

Cable cell probeset addresses that are described by a ``locset`` may generate
more than one concrete probe: there will be one per location in the locset that
is satisfiable. Sampler callback functions can distinguish between different
probes with the same address and id by examining their index and/or
probe-specific metadata found in the ``probe_metadata`` parameter.

.. _sampling_api:

Sampling API
------------

The new API replaces the flexible but irreducibly inefficient scheme
where the next sample time for a sampling was determined by the
return value of the sampler callback.


Definitions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

probe
    A location or component of a cell that is available for monitoring.

sample
    A record of data corresponding to the value at a specific *probe* at a specific time.

sampler
    A function or function object that receives a sequence of *sample* records.

schedule
    A function or function object that, given a time interval, returns a list of sample times within that interval.



Probes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Probes are specified in the recipe objects that are used to initialize a
simulation; the specification of the item or value that is subjected to a
probe will be specific to a particular cell type.

.. container:: api-code

   .. code-block:: cpp

            struct probe_info {
               cell_tag_type tag;     // opaque key, returned in sample record
               any address;           // cell-type specific location info

               template <typename X>
               probe_info(X&& x, nullptr_t) = delete;

               template <typename X>
               probe_info(X&& x, const cell_tag_type& tag):
                   tag(tag), address(std::forward<X>(x)) {}
           };

           std::vector<probe_info> recipe::get_probes(cell_gid_type gid);


The ``tag`` field identifies the probe locally on this global id ``gid``, e.g.
it is used in conjunction to attach samplers,  as ``cell_address_type{gid, tag}``.

Probeset addresses are decoupled from the cell descriptions themselves — this
allows a recipe implementation to construct probes independently of the cells
themselves. It is the responsibility of a cell group implementation to parse the
probeset address objects wrapped in the ``any address`` field, thus the order of
probes returned is important.

One probeset address may describe more than one concrete probe, depending upon
the interpretation of the probeset address by the cell group. In this instance,
each of the concrete probes will be associated with the same probe-id. Samplers
can distinguish between different probes with the same id by their probe index
(see below).

Samplers and sample records
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Data collected from probes (according to a schedule described below)
will be passed to a sampler function or function object:

.. container:: api-code

    .. code-block:: cpp

            struct probe_metadata {
                cell_address_type id; // probeset id
                unsigned index;       // index of probe source within those supplied by probeset id
                util::any_ptr meta;   // probe-specific metadata
            };

            using sampler_function =
                std::function<void (probe_metadata, size_t, const sample_record*)>;

where the parameters are respectively the probe metadata, the number of
samples, and finally a pointer to the sequence of sample records.

The ``probeset_id``, identifies the probe by its probe-id (see above).

The ``index`` identifies which of the possibly multiple probes associated
with the probe-id is the source of the samples.

The ``any_ptr`` value in the metadata points to const probe-specific metadata;
the type of the metadata will depend upon the probeset address specified in the
``probe_info`` provided by the recipe.

One ``sample_record`` struct contains one sample of the probe data at a
given simulation time point:

.. container:: api-code

    .. code-block:: cpp

            struct sample_record {
                time_type time;    // simulation time of sample
                any_ptr data;      // sample data
            };

The ``data`` field points to the sample data, wrapped in ``any_ptr`` for
type-checked access. The exact representation will depend on the nature of
the object that is being probed, but it should depend only on the cell type and
probeset address.

The data pointed to by ``data``, and the sample records themselves, are
only guaranteed to be valid for the duration of the call to the sampler
function. A simple sampler implementation for ``double`` data, assuming
one probe per probeset id, might be as follows:

.. container:: example-code

    .. code-block:: cpp

            using sample_data = std::map<cell_address_type, std::vector<std::pair<double, double>>>;

            struct scalar_sampler {
                sample_data& samples;

                explicit scalar_sample(sample_data& samples): samples(samples) {}

                void operator()(probe_metadata pm, size_t n, const sample_record* records) {
                    for (size_t i=0; i<n; ++i) {
                        const auto& rec = records[i];

                        const double* data = any_cast<const double*>(rec.data);
                        assert(data);
                        samples[pm.id].emplace_back(rec.time, *data);
                    }
                }
            };

The use of ``any_ptr`` allows type-checked access to the sample data, which
may differ in type from probe to probe.


Model and cell group interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Polling rates and sampler functions are set through the
``simulation`` interface, after construction from a recipe.

.. container:: api-code

    .. code-block:: cpp

            using sampler_association_handle = std::size_t;
            using cell_member_predicate = std::function<bool (cell_member_type)>;

            sampler_association_handle simulation::add_sampler(
                cell_member_predicate probeset_ids,
                schedule sched,
                sampler_function fn)

            void simulation::remove_sampler(sampler_association_handle);

            void simulation::remove_all_samplers();

Multiple samplers can then be associated with the same probe locations.
The handle returned is only used for managing the lifetime of the
association. The ``cell_member_predicate`` parameter defines the
set of probeset ids in terms of a membership test.

We provide a few helper functions are provided for making ``cell_member_predicate`` objects:

.. container:: api-code

   .. code-block:: cpp

           // Match all probeset ids.
           cell_member_predicate
           all_probes = [](const cell_address_type& pid) { return true; };

           // Match just one probeset id.
           cell_member_predicate
           one_probe(const cell_address_type& pid) { return [pid](const auto& x) { return pid==x; }; }

           // Match all probes on a given ``gid``.
           cell_member_predicate
           one_gid(const cell_gid_type& gid) { return [gid](const auto& x) { return gid==x.gid; }; }

           // Match all probes with a given ``tag``.
           cell_member_predicate
           one_tag(const cell_tag_type& tag) { return [tag](const auto& x) { return tag==x.tag; }; }

The simulation object will pass on the sampler setting request to the cell
group that owns the given probeset id. The ``cell_group`` interface will be
correspondingly extended:

.. container:: api-code

   .. code-block:: cpp

           void cell_group::add_sampler(sampler_association_handle h,
                                       cell_member_predicate probeset_ids,
                                       sample_schedule sched,
                                       sampler_function fn);

           void cell_group::remove_sampler(sampler_association_handle);

           void cell_group::remove_all_samplers();

Cell groups will invoke the corresponding sampler function directly, and may
aggregate multiple samples with the same probeset id in one call to the sampler.
Calls to the sampler are synchronous, in the sense that processing of the cell
group state does not proceed while the sampler function is being executed, but
the times of the samples given to the sampler will typically precede the time
corresponding to the current state of the cell group. It should be expected that
this difference in time should be no greater the the duration of the integration
period (i.e. ``mindelay/2``).


Schedules
^^^^^^^^^

Schedules represent a non-negative, monotonically increasing sequence
of time points, and are used to specify the sampling schedule in any
given association of a sampler function to a set of probes.

A ``schedule`` object has two methods:

.. container:: api-code

   .. code-block:: cpp

       void schedule::reset();

       time_event_span events(time_type t0, time_type t1)

A ``time_event_span`` is a ``std::pair`` of pointers `const time_type*`,
representing a view into an internally maintained collection of generated
time values.

The ``events(t0, t1)`` method returns a view of monotonically
increasing time values in the half-open interval ``[t0, t1)``.
Successive calls to ``events`` — without an intervening call to ``reset()``
—  must request strictly subsequent intervals.

The data represented by the returned ``time_event_span`` view is valid
for the lifetime of the ``schedule`` object, and is invalidated by any
subsequent call to ``reset()`` or ``events()``.

The ``reset()`` method resets the state such that events can be retrieved
from again from time zero. A schedule that is reset must then produce
the same sequence of time points, that is, it must exhibit repeatable
and deterministic behaviour.

The ``schedule`` object itself uses type-erasure to wrap any schedule
implementation class, which can be any copy--constructible class that
provides the methods ``reset()`` and ``events(t0, t1)`` above. Three
schedule implementations are provided by the engine:

.. container:: api-code

   .. code-block:: cpp


           // Schedule at integer multiples of dt:
           schedule regular_schedule(time_type dt);

           // Schedule at a predetermined (sorted) sequence of times:
           template <typename Seq>
           schedule explicit_schedule(const Seq& seq);

           // Schedule according to Poisson process with lambda = 1/mean_dt
           template <typename RandomNumberEngine>
           schedule poisson_schedule(time_type mean_dt, const RandomNumberEngine& rng);

The ``schedule`` class and its implementations are found in ``schedule.hpp``.

Helper classes for probe/sampler management
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``simulation`` and ``cable_cell_group`` classes use classes defined in
``scheduler_map.hpp`` to simplify the management of sampler--probe associations
and probe metadata.

``sampler_association_map`` wraps an ``unordered_map`` between sampler association
handles and tuples (*schedule*, *sampler*, *probe set*), with thread-safe
accessors.


Batched sampling in ``cable_cell_group``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``fvm_multicell`` implementations for CPU and GPU simulation of multi-compartment
cable neurons perform sampling in a batched manner: when their integration is
initialized, they take a sequence of ``sample_event`` objects which are used to
populate an implementation-specific ``event_stream`` that describes for each
cell the sample times and what to sample over the integration interval.

When an integration step for a cell covers a sample event on that cell, the sample
is satisfied with the value from the cell state at the beginning of the time step,
after any postsynaptic spike events have been delivered.

It is the responsibility of the ``cable_cell_group::advance()`` method to create the sample
events from the entries of its ``sampler_association_map``, and to dispatch the
sampled values to the sampler callbacks after the integration is complete.
Given an association tuple (*schedule*, *sampler*, *probe set*) where the *schedule*
has (non-zero) *n* sample times in the current integration interval, the ``cable_cell_group`` will
call the *sampler* callback once for probe in *probe set*, with *n* sample values.

.. note::

   When the time values returned by a call to a schedule's ``events(t0, t1)`` method do not
   perfectly coincide with the boundaries of the numerical time step grid, :math:`[t_0, t_0 + dt,
   t_0 + 2\, dt, \, \cdots \, , t_1)`, the samples will be taken at the closest possible point in
   time. In particular, any sample times :math:`t_s \in \left( t_i - dt/2,~ t_i + dt/2\right]` are
   attributed to simulation time step :math:`t_i = t_0 + i\,dt`.
